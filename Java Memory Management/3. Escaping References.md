## What is escaping reference?

Consider this code:

```
public class CustomerRecords {
	private Map<String, Customer> records;
	
	public CustomerRecords() {
		this.records = new HashMap<>();
	}
	
	public void addCustomer(Customer c){
		this.records.put(c.getName(), c);
	}
	
	public Map<String, Customer> getCustomers() {
		return this.records;
	}
}
```

We have the method 	`getCustomers` which gives the reference to the map of records. Now someone can write a nasty code from the calling code:

```
CustomerRecords records = new CustomerRecords();
Map<String, Customer> customers = records.getCustomers();
customers.clear();
```
The reference to the `Map` has escaped from the class in which it should have been encapsulated. It is almost as if we have declared this `Map` as a public variable.

How do we address this issue?<br>
References can only be escaped if have we have methods which are returning a pointer to the object. In our example, `getCustomers` method is returning a pointer to the records object. So, we are looking for ways to avoid returning pointers to the existing objects.

First approach could be to just implement `Iterable` interface:

```
public class CustomerRecords implements Iterable<Customer> {
	private Map<String, Customer> records;
	
	public CustomerRecords() {
		this.records = new HashMap<>();
	}
	
	public void addCustomer(Customer c){
		this.records.put(c.getName(), c);
	}
	
	public Iterator<Customer> iterator(){
		return records.values().iterate();
	}
	/*public Map<String, Customer> getCustomers() {
		return this.records;
	}*/
}
```
Having done this, in the calling code, we could simply do this:
```
for(Customer c : records){
	System.out.println(c.getName());
}
```

But there is a problem with this approach- `Iterator` has a method `remove`. So I could do this:

```
records.iterator().remove()
```
This still allows me to mutate the collection. So, a better solution could be to return a new instance of the collection:
```
public Map<String, Customer> getCustomers() {
		return new HashMap<String, Customer>(this.records);
}
```
So, now we are returning a copy of the map.
This is what happens:

But still we can change the underlying objects in the collection. So, the a good solution will be to return an ummutable collection. A collection which cannot be edited.
The `Collections` class contain methods : `Collections.unmodifyableMap`,`Collections.un,modifyableList` etc. So let's do that:

```
public Map<String, Customer> getCustomers() {
		return Collections.unmodifyableMap(this.records);
}
```

Now we still will get a copy of original collection and this copy of records cannot be modified. If we do that, we'd get `UnsupportedOperationException`.
Bottomline: When you work with collections, return an unmodifiable collection which returns a copy which cannot be modified at all.


## How to avoid escaping reference?

But what about objects which are not collections?
Suppose we have the following code:
```
public Customer getCustomerByName(String name){
	return this.records.get(name);
}
```

Again, we provided an escaping reference for the customer object and can now we can call a method on this object which could change the state of the object. For example, we could change the customer name. We can write a copy constructor in customer class to solve this:
```
public Customer(Customer cust){
	this.name = cust.getName();
}
```
Now, if we call this copy constructor, we'll get a new object which will contain the same data as the original customer object. Now our `getCustomerByName` will look like this:

```
public Customer getCustomerByName(String name){
	return new Customer(this.records.get(name));
}
```

The proper fix would be only when we could provide a read-only customer object.
Proper fix: Create an interface which has only read only methods and implement this interface with Customer class:
```
public interface CustomerReadOnly {
	public abstract String getName();
	public abstract void toString();
}
```
Now change the `CustomerRecords` like this:
```
public CustomerReadOnly getCustomerByName(String name) {
	return this.records.get(name);
}
```
This now returns `CustomerReadOnly` type which only has read only methods. In return now we don't need a copy constructor.
Now the client (calling class) only sees read only.

But still a client code can typecast to `Customer` and call `setName` on it. But it still gives us some sort of control and avoids someone accidently calling `setName` accidently.
