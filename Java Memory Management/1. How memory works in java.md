# How memort works in java

## Role of the stack

- Every thread has its own stack.
- managed by JVM
- each time a method is called, java pushes local variables for that method on to the stack.

- when anothe method is called from a method, the passing argument's copy is passed as illustrated below:

- greyed out variables would be out of stack when `calculate` is called.

## Introduction to the Heap

- There'll be a pointer to the object which is the variable reference stored on the stack.
