# Values and references

## Passing variables by value

- always a copy of the variable is passed.
- when the `calculate` is called, a copy of variable `localValue` is passed to it as `calcValue`. This is stored on stack and now `localValue` is out of scope:

- But when the method returns, the `calcValue` is popped off the stack and `localValue` comes into the scope:

![IMG2][IMG2]

So, when we run the program, the value is printed is of `localValue`.

- **Java is pass by value**.
