# Values and references

## Passing variables by value

- always a copy of the variable is passed.
- when the `calculate` is called, a copy of variable `localValue` is passed to it as `calcValue`. This is stored on stack and now `localValue` is out of scope:

![IMG1][IMG1]

- But when the method returns, the `calcValue` is popped off the stack and `localValue` comes into the scope:

![IMG2][IMG2]

So, when we run the program, the value is printed is of `localValue`.

- **Java is pass by value**.

## How objects are passed

- when you call a method and pass an object, the variable which contains the reference of the object is passed by value.
- a copy of the pointer of the object is created, Object itself is not created and hence the object itself is not passed but the copy of the pointer of the object is.

- the earlier string will be garbage collected.

# The `final` keyword

- the final variable can be assigned only once.
- for a final object, we cannot change which object on heap the final object points to:

- but we can change the object on heap:

![IMG7][IMG7]

- this is only the reference of which object it points to cannot be changed!
